After approximately 5 years I want to create a more modern version of my first [TinyDefence](https://github.com/Milchreis/TinyDefence) game. Here is the result of my little hackathon.
TinyDefence 2 is a simple implementation of the tower defence principe (build towers to fight against the incoming enemies). Now it's build with the [phaser game engine](http://phaser.io/), which I also used for my platformer game [I Hate Zombies](https://github.com/Milchreis/I-Hate-Zombies). The game is hosted on github and is ready to play.
